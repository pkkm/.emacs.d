* Performance

  If Emacs is slow, use the profiler to find out why:

  1. ~M-x profiler-start RET RET~.
  2. Use Emacs for a while.
  3. ~M-x profiler-report~.

* Features to use more

  - M-) :: Add a sexp at the current level.
  - C-M-c :: Exit recursive edit (resumes the command that started the recursive edit; e.g. when used in the debugger, continues execution).
  - C-SPC :: Search the current set of results in ido-mode.
  - Text registers :: Instead of using the kill ring and pressing C-p/M-y a bunch of times ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/61dank/what_are_some_advanced_editing_techniques_that/][inspiration]]).

* Keys to bind

** Normal state

   - g z
   - g y
   - g l
   - g k
   - g j
   - g RET

*** Redundant

    - C-j :: Same as RET.
    - C-k :: Kill line (same as d$).

*** Unused

    - C-t :: Pop the tag mark.

** Normal and insert state

   - C-,
   - C-;
