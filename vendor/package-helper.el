;;; package-helper.el --- nice macros/functions for use with package

;;; Commentary:

;; The two important macros are `with-package' and `with-package*'.
;; Package names given to these are automatically installed by
;; `package-install' and the body of these macros are not evaluated
;; until the listed packages are actually loaded, similar to
;; `eval-after-load'. The latter macro will automatically `require'
;; the listed packages.

;; Examples:

;;     (with-package skewer-mode
;;       ... <config for skewer-mode> ...)

;;     (with-package (js2-mode less-css-mode)
;;       ... <config depending on both packages> ...)

;; To set up configuration after package has been activated but before
;; it has been loaded, append a * to the package name. It's useful for
;; adding keybindings to autoloaded functions. The macros provided
;; here are smart enough to find the real package name from the
;; special name.

;; Remember to call `package-initialize' in your config *before*
;; making use of these macros.

PACKAGES for installation by `package-install'. PACKAGES can be
either a single symbol or a list of symbols.

  BODY is only ever evaluated once, and only after all PACKAGES
have been loaded. This means if any of the listed packages are
loaded, the others will be immediately loaded as well.

  The body is wrapped in a function so that it gets properly
compiled. Normally with `eval-after-load' it gets quoted for a
literal future `eval', so it appears as data to the compiler."
